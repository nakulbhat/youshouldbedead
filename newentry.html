                <p>Ah! It's time. A birthday. Your birthday. Time for another excuse to get blackout drunk? Time for another puff of a strawberry flavoured cigarette? Time for an evening of regret? Time for another day of self-loathing? Time for another night of scoring your thighs? Time for silent sobs over the phone with me? 
                    <br><br>
                    Look at how far you've come. I am proud of you. I really am. A year ago, you sent an audio on whatsapp to me. Completely out of the blue. I heard the melodious voice of a nun, singing you happy birthday. The audio got deleted 20s later, but by making a habit of instant replies, I managed to save it. Not the one the nun sent. that's useless. It's the one I sent to you immediately after. I still have it. I still listen to it. I still smile. I still feel like the idiot behind that.
                </p>
                <p><br>A year ago, we were nobodies. Just two souls drifting through the cosmos. Today, we're making a name for ourselves. Tbh, it's me doing the heavy lifting but I believe that you'll shine when your time comes. It's okay where you are. You're doing something I never could.</p>
                <p><br>It's been a year and a bit since I've known you. I've seen you grow. I've seen you fall. I've seen you rise. I've seen you cry. I've seen you laugh. I've seen you smile. I've seen you frown. Everything. It's such a special feeling. I've known you only for 7% of your life, but it feels like you're my long lost sibling. All the fights, all the banter, the food wars and blackmail. It's been a wild ride. I'm glad I'm on it with you.</p>
                <p>This birthday wish is going too rosy for a little shit like you. Now that I am fairly sure your mom has clicked off, I can get real with a statue. Yo still aprendo espanol de Duolingo. apologies for the broken espanol, but I can't speak properly because your tiny brain won't be able to comprehend it. It's about you today and what I do doesn't matter.</p>
